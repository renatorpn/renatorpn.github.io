## the burnout society (Byung-Chul Han)

Byung-Chul Han is one of my favorite modern philosophers and that's the reason he appears in this list twice. In this book Byung-Chul Han explains how society moved from the negative model (nicht-dürfen, sollen - may not or should not), in which control over workers is done by prohibitive methods, to the positive model (können - can) where the control over workers and production is done by "empowerement, inititive or motiviation". While at a first glance society may see the shift this positive model as freeing and liberating, it is actually how society becomes a victim of its own exploitation - basically exploiting ourselves to burnout.

## psychopolitcs: neoliberalism and new technologies of power (Byung-Chul Han)

In this book Han explore how Foucault's idea of panopticon society published in [Discipline and Punish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discipline_and_Punish) is intrisically baked into today's neoliberal society, gig economy and hustle culture. Han explains how big data and analytics fit in this dynamic of self exploitation and constant benchmarking empowered by the positive model. 

I highly recommend reading this just after The Burnout Society.

## dream story (arthur schnitzler)

Do you like thrillers? Do you like depravity and ambiguity? Do you like wondering what is and isn't real? Did you enjoy Eyes Wide Shut? If so, this is a good read.

## the conquest of bread (pyotr kropotkin)

RConcepts such as decentralization, mutual aid and cooperation are the ethos of open source community. Reading this book was crucial for me to understand how technology plays a big part in society and how it should be used to empower those who use it, and not slave us.
