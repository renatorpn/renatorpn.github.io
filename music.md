The sonic and lyrical paragon of brazilian music. Lado B Lado A paints scenes of Rio de Janeiro suburban and favela families with careful detailed strokes of alt rock, reggae and brazilian/latin rhythms. This album perfectly captures the struggles, daily life, aspirations and boredom of thousands of Rio de Janeiro families living in the outskirts of the city. A 90s masterpiece that still remains modern to this day with tasteful bass lines and lyrics and transports you right to a humble home in Engenho Novo.

>*The electricity went out but it was broad daylight
<br>The sun invaded the living room
<br>And thus made a mirror from the TV screen 
<br>Reflecting things we once forgot
<br>The electricity went out but it was broad daylight
<br>The sound of kids playing outside as if it was a backyard
<br>The cold beer at the liquor store as if it purged all evil
<br>A good herbal tea to cure this heartburn
<br>All the lo-fi sciences
<br>All the colors hidden in the routine of the daily life
<br>For us to see between us and the skyscrappers
<br>For us to see what's left of heaven*

## Propagandhi - Potemkin City Limits (2005)

Propagandhi is one of my favorite artists of all time. Potemkin City Limits certainly doesn't settle for its punk/hardcore confinements and expands territory into more nuanced instrumental and lyrical work.

I consider this to be a documental piece of art exposing the beginning of the rapture of the american dream. This album depicts the mid 2000s north american paranoia, rise of ultra nationalism under the George W. Bush administration and the crumbling façade of capitalism.

## Nine Inch Nails - With Teeth (2005)

My favourite NiN record. Claustrophobic, chaotic, digitally cacophonic, yet hauntfully beatiful and very accessible "pop" tracks on this one.

## A Tribe Called Quest - Midnight Marauders (1993)

Juicy af, alternative hip hop, flows like a mf. Precise presentation, bass heavy and just right. ;)

## El Efecto - Memórias do Fogo (2018)

Putting this album into a single genre wouldn't do any justice to this sonically diverse experience. Expect tight rythmn samba, horns, posthardcore breakdowns, progressive song structure and many other brazilian/latin influences. Clever lyrics riddled with word plays and popular sayings.
