Back to when I started to branch into computer security (in the broadest sense of the word), I didn't know where to start and what to study for. There wasn't a clear guide, study path or job posting (at least in my country) in this field, it all seemed so ethereal as if only linux greybeards or phracks born kids could get into the field. Although it may seem that was aeons ago, it was actually in 2016 and so much has changed for people coming into the field - Some good, for example we now have great content creators and study material (THM, LiveOverflow) readily available and acessible. And now for the bad... Certifications shitfest.

The easist way back then (and unfortunately to this day) to get started in this field was certifications. Relying on certifications as a way to screen candidates is really bad practice and I do believe that it hurts the industry as a whole.

#### Knowledge should be democratic

First of all, certifications require money, not only for the exam but also for the course material - Books, labs, exercises, lessons, retakes... A certification (or any title for that fact) is rarely if ever just the exam fee price. While I do understand that a exam fee guarantees the maintenance of technical resources (labs for practice exam, infrastructure and etc), I cannot understand 500+ USD fees for self proctored exams.

A candidate that has financial means of achieving a given certification does not necessarily means that they spent more time or knows any bit more than a candidate that has not achieved a certification. I'm not talking shit about certified professionals nor I'm just salty because I failed an extremely hard certification, it's just because not everybody has had the same financial conditions I had in my carreer. Don't even get me started on certifications that are LOCKED behind mandatory courses or yearly subscription models costing up to thousands of dollars. 

Putting a paywall behind a certification does not ensure fair access - if anything eliminates and disencourages potential learners. No knowledge should be restricted behind a paywall.

#### Yearly subscription models over the thousand dollars invesment are bullshit

999.99 USD for a ONE TIME, YEARLY payment to have access to your courses tailored almost as a brain dump for your certification and you're saying that if I throw couple hundred more bones I get ONE EXAM VOUCHER for free? Sheesh, that's a deal.

#### Certifications abstract and dillute fundamental knowledge
