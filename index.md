# Welcome!

Hi, I'm just another cowboy in the cyberspace.

I like Linux and mangling vulnerable pieces of code apart.

In this cyberspace I keep a [blog](blog). I'm also making my own digital garden for note taking - [manpages](manpages/manpages), which should be done anytime soon.

See you, space cowboy...
