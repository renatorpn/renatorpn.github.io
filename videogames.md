## Currently playing

### [Unsighted](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062110/UNSIGHTED/)

This game is an addicting metroidvania that plays very much like a cross between top down Zelda and Hyperlight Drifter. My favourite thing about this game is that has a time sensitive death mechanic for upgrade NPCs that reminds me so much of Majora's Mask and you can disable it if you wish.


### [Wargroove](https://wargroove.com/)

<center><img style="margin: 0 px;" src="/assets/images/videogames/wargroove.gif" alt="Animated gif screenshot of the game, depicting a pixelated battlefield with units and attack moves"/></center>

Wargroove is a beautiful strategy game that takes heavy inspiration in Advanced Wars. There are different 5 factions (one added in the free DLC), a campaign spanning 33 missions total, arcade mode, unlockable concept art, multiplayer (up to 4 players) and supports sharing and playing custom maps and campaigns. Gorgeous art style and it feels just right in the Nintendo Switch.

### [Stardew Valley](https://www.stardewvalley.net/)

I prefer this over Animal Crossing because I feel that Stardew Valley respects more my time as a player instead of imposing strict days of the week where certain things take place (yes, I know I can circumvent this...). You can take your time to do your stuff as the in game clock is not the same as the real world clock, farm some crops or even play an entire season in one sitting. Amazing support from the devs with free updates 'til this day. Someday I'll upload my farm here.
