My name is Renato and welcome to my digital garden. This is my home for posting my research notes and snippets.

I've been working in the tech industry for 10+ years, 6 of those years in the cybersecurity industry in a wide variety of technical roles. In the past few years I've been focusing on application security and testing applications.

Currently away from my home country. My languages are portuguese, spanish and english.

My opinions are my own and they can and WILL be wrong sometimes - please, contact me so I can listen to you.
