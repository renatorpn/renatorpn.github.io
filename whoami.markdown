# greetings, fellow human

Welcome to the void. This is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) - This is where I write notes, bookmark and scream my thoughts in the world wide web.

This site is made to as clean, light and easy to understand and deploy as possible, but be advised that I'm not a frontend developer and 90% of the time, I don't know what I'm doing. Feel free to use my code at your will, but do expect bad practices and stuff not working.

During the day I work doing computer security stuff at $COMPANY. During the night I'm a necromancer of cursed software.

This garden is powered by:
* jekyll; 
* github pages;
* vim;
* css, html and markdown (no CSS);
* h-card (implementation in progress);

## interests:

* punk rock / hardcore;
* late 90s animes & aesthetic stuff;
* indieweb;
* politics;
* reverse engineering;
* application security;
* emudev;
* videogames;

## my links:

* [twitter](https://twitter.com/renato_rpn);
* [github](https://github.com/renatorpn);
* [email] **soon**;
