# ★★ greetings, fellow human ★★

Welcome to the void. This is my [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) - This is where I write notes, bookmark and scream my thoughts in the world wide web.

This site is made to as clean, light and easy to understand and deploy as possible, but be advised that I'm not a frontend developer and 90% of the time, I don't know what I'm doing. Feel free to use my code at your will, but do expect bad practices and stuff not working.

I'm currently away from my home country. My languages are portuguese, spanish and english.

I've been and I will be many things in this life - First and foremost: **I'm a human and I care about people.** My opinions are my own and they can be wrong sometimes - please, contact me so I can listen to you. To quote Propagandhi - ["I will call you on your shit please call me on mine, then we can grow together and make this shit-hole planet better"](https://propagandhi.com/lyrics/apparently-im-a-pc-fascist)

During the day I work doing computer security stuff at `$COMPANY`. During the night I'm a necromancer of cursed software.

Feel free to contact me if you want to develop or start an open source project.

This garden is powered by:
* jekyll;

* css, html and markdown (no JS, no bloat, no tracking);
* h-card (implementation in progress);
